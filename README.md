### Hi there 👋
I'm a full stack developer! I've worked for Bowling Green State University as an intern, at Abercrombie & Fitch, and now building web apps for WillowTree! Most of my experience is in Front-End, having launched projects in React and Vue, but I have exposure to Node.js, Java, and Swift. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my own personal design system
- 🌱 I’m currently refining my React and Node skills
- 🕔 In my freetime I like to ⛷ ski ✈️ travel 🏕 hike and camp  
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
